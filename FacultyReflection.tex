\chapter[Faculty composition and qualifications]{Faculty:  reflect on the
composition, qualifications and development of the faculty}
\section{Provide information on each of the following}
\subsection{Quantity and quality of the faculty needed to meet the needs of the
program or discipline.}
The total number of full time faculty at all campuses between 2011 and 2013
varied between 36 to 41 and the 
part time faculty varied between 143 to 158 on any given term,  not including
Summer.     The percent of \emph{all} courses (pre-college and college level)
taught by full-time instructors during this time period varied from a low of
24.9\% at Cascade to a high of 41\% at Sylvania (see
\cref{reflect:tab:percentallcourses}).

From the academic year 2008 to 2012 there was a significant increase in the
number of students taking math courses at all campuses as shown
\cref{reflect:tab:enrollment}.

In reference to ``quality of the faculty needed to meet the needs of the discipline,''  it is insufficient to look at degree or experience qualifications alone.  Even a short list of what we expect from our mathematics faculty would include, but not be limited to that she/he:
\begin{itemize}
  \item possess an understanding of effective mathematics teaching methodologies and      strategies, and be able to adjust in response to student needs
  \item  
teach  the course content as outlined in CCOGs and with the appropriate mathematical  rigor
\item show genuine commitment to students' success
\item identify problems when students encounter difficulties learning
\item demonstrate an ongoing intellectual curiosity about the relationship
  between teaching and learning
\item manage classroom learning environments and effectively handle student
  discipline problems
\item demonstrate technological literacy needed in the teaching of mathematics
\item participate in professional organizations
\item develop, evaluate and revise the mathematics curricula
\item serve and contribute to the PCC community as a whole through campus and
  district wide committees and activities
\end{itemize}
In addition, with the enormous enrollment increases of the past several years,
there are more students than ever needing both remediation in mathematics and
guidance in general about what it takes to be a successful college student.

Addressing this section heading directly, the `quantity' of full-time faculty
needed to achieve the `quality' goals noted above is currently inadequate.  It
is primarily the full-time faculty that has the time, resources and
institutional support to fully realize the expectations noted above.  Part-time
faculty are dedicated, but the expectations are different given their
compensation.   To increase the probability that a student moves successfully
through our mathematics courses without sacrificing quality, having a larger
full-time faculty presence than currently exists would help with this goal.

In recognizing the need for more full-time faculty, we do not want to downplay
the skills and talents of our part-time faculty.  We have approximately 150
part-time instructors that serve our students each term many of whom have
teaching experience from other colleges and universities; they bring additional
experiences from industry, other sciences, high school and middle school
education, and so much more.  Since they teach such a high percentage of our
classes, their success is crucial to our students' success.

\subsection{Recommendation}
\recommendation{Given PCC's limited resources, the MTH SAC welcomes the input
of the administration to help us prioritize our various needs and find/develop
targeted and effective professional development for as many faculty members as
possible, including part-time faculty.  }

\subsection{Extent of faculty turnover and changes anticipated in the next five
years.} 
Since 2011, ten full-time instructors have been hired and eleven full-time
instructors have left campuses across the district.  Of the eleven full-time
instructors who left, five retired, one left to pursue other job opportunities,
and one returned to another teaching job after the term of the PCC position
ended.  Three of the retirements occurred at Sylvania and one each at Rock
Creek and Cascade.  Four full-time instructors left one campus in order to work
full-time at another campus.   There was one transfer from Cascade to Rock
Creek, one from Cascade to Sylvania, one from Rock Creek to Cascade, and one
from Rock Creek to Sylvania.  In the next five years, similar turnover with
full-time faculty is expected.

Since 2011, 53 part-time instructors have been hired and 35 part-time
instructors have left campuses across the district.  Of the three campuses,
Rock Creek has the most part time faculty turnover, followed by Cascade and
Sylvania.  Reasons for leaving varied, but at least eight of the part-time
instructors who left campuses simply moved to another campus in the district
(see \vref{app:sec:facultyDegrees}).

\subsection{Extent of the reliance upon part-time faculty and how they compare
with full-time faculty in terms of educational and experiential backgrounds.}
Across the district, the mathematics departments rely heavily upon part-time
faculty to teach the majority of the math classes offered.  Between 2011 and
2013, 75.1\% of the classes at Cascade were taught by part-time instructors,
71.8\% at Rock Creek, 72.7\% at Southeast, and 59\% at Sylvania.  This reliance
on part-time faculty to teach classes has been a challenge to the departments
in a number of ways.  First, the turnover of part-time faculty is higher and
thus there is a need to orient new employees more frequently and provide
mentoring and guidance to them as well.  Second, many part-time faculty are on
campus only to teach their courses, and thus often do not attend meetings and
keep up with current SAC discussions on curriculum.  For these reasons, classes
have a higher probability to be taught with less consistency than the
mathematics SAC would like.  Increasing the number of full-time faculty (and
thus decreasing the dependence on part-time faculty) would mitigate much of
this inconsistency (see \vref{app:sec:analysisPTFT}).

Part-time faculty educational backgrounds vary much more than the full-time
faculty backgrounds.  Full-time instructors have master's or doctorate degrees
in mathematics or related fields with extensive math graduate credits.  About a
quarter of the part-time instructors have bachelor's degrees and the rest have
either a master's or doctorate degree.  The part-time instructors come from a
variety of employment backgrounds and have different reasons for working
part-time.  They may be high school instructors (active or retired), may come
from a household in which only one member is working full time while the other
teaches part time, may be recently graduated MS or MAT students seeking full
time employment, may be working full time elsewhere in a non-educational field,
or may be retired from a non-educational field (see
\vref{app:sec:facultyDegrees}).

\subsection{How the faculty composition reflects the diversity and cultural
competency goals of the institution.}
The mathematics SAC is deeply committed to fostering an inclusive campus
climate at each location that respects all individuals regardless of race,
color, religion, ethnicity, use of native language, national origin, sex,
marital status, height/weight ratio, disability, veteran status, age, or sexual
orientation.  Many of these human characteristics noted above are not
measurable nor necessarily discernible.  However, PCC does gather data on
gender and race/ethnicity, as detailed in \cref{reflect:tab:racialethnicmakeup}
(see also the extensive demographic data displayed in
\vref{app:sec:demographicdata}).

\begin{table}[!htb]
  \centering
  \caption{Racial/Ethnic Make-up of PCC Faculty and Students}

  \begin{tabular}{rrrr}
    \toprule

            \midrule
    Male    & 54.1\%    & 53.2\%     & 55\% \\

    Native American & 0.0\%  &  0.0\%  &  1\%\\
    Unknown/International   & 12.2\% &  4.3\% &    3\%\\
    Caucasian   & 75.7\%   & 85.1\%   & 68\%\\
    \bottomrule

\end{table}

Our SAC will continue to strive toward keeping our faculty body ethnically
diverse and culturally competent, but it is an area where improvement is
needed. In terms of hiring, there is a shortage of minorities in the Science, Technology, Engineering
and Mathematics (STEM) undergraduate and graduate programs, which makes our
recruitment of minority faculty difficult.

Recommendations for Program Review:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \recommendation{Math chairs and deans should strongly recommend that full-time faculty
    attend workshops related to diversity and cultural competency issues.}
  \item \recommendation{Departments should be encouraged to provide diversity/cultural
  competency training for part-time faculty as part of their contractual
  meeting requirements.}
\item \recommendation{Hiring committees need to work with HR to identify
  and aggressively target mathematics graduate programs in the Northwest with
  minority students who are seeking teaching positions in community colleges.}
  \item \recommendation{Departments on all campuses should increase efforts to find candidates
    for the Faculty Diversity Internship Program \cite{affirmativeaction}.}
\end{itemize}
\section{Report any changes the SAC has made to instructor qualifications since
the last review and the reason for the changes.}
In Spring 2011, prompted by the transfer of Math 20 from Developmental
Education (DE) to the Mathematics SAC, the math instructor qualifications were
changed.  Math 20 had been the only remaining mathematics course in the DE SAC.  

The transfer included transitioning three full-time math DE math instructors at
Sylvania into the Math Department at Sylvania.  At this time, instructor
qualifications for math faculty were examined and changed to reflect the
inclusion of DE math faculty.  It was determined that separate qualifications
should be written for pre-college and college level courses.  These
qualifications were written so that all of the full-time DE math faculty
transitioning into the math department (as well as any new DE math faculty
hired) were qualified to teach the pre-college level courses and any new math
faculty were qualified to teach all of the math courses.  

For instance, a masters degree in mathematics education (instead of just
mathematics) was included as an optional qualification for full-time
instructors teaching pre-college level courses.  Also a masters degree in
mathematics education became an option for part-time instructors teaching MTH
211--213 (the sequence for elementary education math teachers).  Additionally,
at the request of the administration, the terms `part-time' and `full-time'
were removed from instructor qualifications in order to satisfy accreditation
requirements.  Instead of labeling what had traditionally been part-time
qualifications as `part-time,' these qualifications were labeled `Criteria for
Provisional Instructors.'

In Winter 2013, the math instructor qualifications were again changed.  This
time at the request of the math department chairs.  The `provisional' labeling
from the last revision had required math department chairs to regularly
re-certify part-time (`provisional') instructors.  In order to avoid this
unnecessary paperwork, the SAC adopted a three-tiered qualification structure
based on full-time, part-time, and provisionally-approved part-time instructors
(mainly graduate students currently working on graduate degrees).  The
part-time (non-provisional) tier was labeled `Demonstrated Competency.'
Complete details are given in \vref{app:sec:instructorquals}.
